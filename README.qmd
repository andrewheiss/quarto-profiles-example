# Quarto profiles example

It's possible to create multiple versions of the same document with the same output format (i.e. multiple types of PDFs) using Quarto's [Project Profiles](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/profiles.html). This repository shows a quick example of how to do it.

There are three `_quarto.yml` files here:

1. `_quarto.yml` defines the overall project settings and sets the default profile to `nice`:

   ``` yaml
   project:
     title: "Profiles example"
   
   profile: 
     default: nice
   ```

2. `_quarto-nice.yml` defines the document settings when using the `nice` profile (with [EB Garamond](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond) and [Jost](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jost) from Google Fonts). It places the rendered PDF in a folder named "output":

   ``` yaml
   project:
     output-dir: "output"
   
   format:
     pdf:
       mainfont: "EB Garamond"
       sansfont: "Jost"
   ```

3. `_quarto-ugly.yml` defines the document settings when using the `ugly` profile. It places the rendered PDF in a folder named "output-ugly":

   ``` yaml
   project:
     output-dir: "output-ugly"
   
   format:
     pdf:
       mainfont: "Comic Sans MS"
       sansfont: "Papyrus"
   ```

With these three files, rendering the document will automatically use the `nice` profile and generate a PDF like this at [`output/example.pdf`](output/example.pdf):

![](img/example-nice.png){width=100%}

To generate the ugly PDF, you can either set an environment variable:

``` sh
export QUARTO_PROFILE=ugly
asdf
quarto render example.qmd
```

Or use a command line option:

``` sh
quarto render example.qmd --profile ugly
```

This will tell Quarto to use the `ugly` profile and it will generate a PDF like this at [`output-ugly/example.pdf`](output-ugly/example.pdf):

![](img/example-ugly.png){width=100%}
